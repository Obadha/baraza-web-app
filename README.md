# baraza-webapp
Web app for baraza.
This will be built using Python's flask framework, and hosted on heroku.

The Baraza Web App will be a dynamic website where anyone can visit for more information on how the baraza system works. Information that will be found here will be:
> 1. Information on what baraza is, how it works.
> 2. Anyone can view information on reported cases. These cases will be pulled from the database, but user information will be withheld such that, viewers can only see reported cases and the status.
> 3. Admin will use this site to register chiefs.
